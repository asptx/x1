This plugin is a tool used to easily add advertising to your site, chose its content and add your own trackers.


== Description ==
The CrakRevenue Wordpress plugin is a tool that presents you a wide array of advertising tools that you can use on your
Wordpress site. You can have popups that will open hidden from the user, replace words in the text by in-text ads
pointing to landing pages, native ads that will display under your articles or even banners or lists of live cams you
can put almost anywhere on the site. It\'s all powered by CrakRevenue.com\'s robust infrastructure that ensures you get
the most lucrative ad content possible for the verticals you chose.


== Installation ==
In the admin page, go to the Plugin page.
Click on \"Add new\"
Then click on \"Upload Plugin\" then find your .zip file

Then once this is done a CrakRevenue\'s green whale icon should show in your left menu. Click on it to access the
settings.

REMEMBER: You have to save your changes on each tab by clicking \"SAVE CHANGES\"

Now if you don\'t already have an existing CrakRevenue account, you need to make one here:

Once you have your account find your \"Affiliate ID\" on this page:

You\'ll then have the option to activate several modules.

Popup
This module can pop a landing page once every 24 hours.

In-text ads
This module will transform the words you chose to be turned into links pointing to the type of content of your choice.

Native Ads
This module will display links under the posts. You have several options at your disposal to customize how they are
displayed.


== Widgets ==
This plugin adds 2 widgets to the Widgets page. To use them in your site, go to Appearance>Widget. Then drag the widget
from the left columns to the slot you want on the right. After that you can set the tracking info and other settings. To
Remove a widget, drag it out of the zone where you put it.

Banner Widget
This module adds the CrakRevenue Banner Widget to the widget settings page. The banners are 300x250.

Cams Widget
This module adds the CrakRevenue Cams Widget to the widget settings page. You can choose to either display female or
male performers. Then the module will detect the most appropriate performers to display based on the content of the page
where the widget is displayed.
THE CAMS WIDGET NEEDS TO CONNECTS TO OUR CAMS API ONCE A MINUTE IN ORDER TO FUNCTION. IF YOU DON'T WANT TO ALLOW
COMMUNICATION WITH OUR API, DON'T USE THE CAMS WIDGET.
